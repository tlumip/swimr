\arguments{
\item{db}{The scenario sqlite database.}

\item{facet_var}{Field to facet by: "MPO", "COUNTY", or "STATE".}

\item{facet_levels}{A character vector of the variable specifiying
which levels to include.}

\item{color_levels}{A character vector of the industry sectors to include.
Defaults to all.}

\item{index_year}{[Optional] index year that should be used as the starting year for data or plots;}

\value{
A \code{data_frame} with the participation rate in each facet region
  in each transport model year.

\description{
BLS defines the civilian labor force participation rate as the percent of
individuals age 16 and over who are either working or who are looking for
work. This is not something we ask about in travel surveys generally, so
it is not possible to make an apples-to-apples comparison.
}
\details{
This function returns the number of workers in each facet region divided
by the number of individuals fifteen years and older in that region. The
definition of a "worker" in a travel model is different than the BLS definition
in that travel models do not consider unemployed individuals who are looking
for work.

We call our definition "workers to adult population ratio," or "WAPR". Again,
it corresponds to the labor force participation rate but is not precisely
defined.
