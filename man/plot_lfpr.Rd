\description{
BLS defines the civilian labor force participation rate as the percent of
individuals age 16 and over who are either working or who are looking for
work. This is not something we ask about in travel surveys generally, so it is
not possible to make an apples-to-apples comparison.
}
\details{
This function returns the number of workers in each facet region divided by
the number of individuals fifteen years and older in that region. The
definition of a "worker" in a travel model is different than the BLS
definition in that travel modesl do not consider unemployed individuals who
are looking for work.
